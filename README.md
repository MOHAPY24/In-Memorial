## 🌊 About

Baby Noir fought through so much—ich, tank life, and everything in between—and she deserved to be remembered. This project is a **living, interactive memorial**: waves, swaying plants, floating bubbles, tiny fish, and gentle sunlight all simulate her little underwater world.

The page is fully interactive: click to create ripples. Every detail was made with love, from the soft bubbly font to the gentle motion of the plants.
